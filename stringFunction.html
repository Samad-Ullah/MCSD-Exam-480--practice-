   /*****  The String function attempts to convert the object argument that is passed into the function
into a string. Consider the scenario in which you have two numbers such as 10 and 20, and
you want to concatenate them like strings and display the resulting string of 1020. You might
try the following code   *****/
   
    <script>
        var a= 10;
        var b= 2;
        
        alert(String(a)+String(b));
    
    </script>
